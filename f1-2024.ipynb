        "F1 Fantasy is well-suited to optimisation when compared to other fantasy sports. The problem space is relatively small - a team consists of only 5 assets, chosen from a pool of 30. You can also change half of your assets each race without a penalty, so planning more than 1 week ahead is almost always unneccesary. This makes for a much easier challenge than e.g. FPL optimisation, where we are choosing 15 assets from hundreds in a multi-period problem. Many drivers are either far too expenisve to be viable at their price point or sufficiently inexpensive to make them essential. Marginal decisions exist, but are less common than in other fantasy sports, which makes modelling it quite forgiving. "

For example, if we want a column of probabilities to add to 1 (e.g. for race winner, since there can be only 1 winner), then we must raise each probability $p_i$ to the same exponent $k$, such that the sum of the probabilities raised to $k$ equals the desired total $T$, i.e. we want $k$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{20}p_i^k=T$"
